DATA ANALYTICS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (FRESHERS)
==================================================

-------------------------------
1. BASIC CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS
-------------------------------

Q1: What is Data Analytics?
A: Data Analytics is the process of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to uncover patterns and insights for informed decision-making.

Q2: What are the types of Data Analytics?
A:
- Descriptive Analytics: What happened?
- Diagnostic Analytics: Why did it happen?
- Predictive Analytics: What will happen?
- Prescriptive Analytics: What should be done?

Q3: What is the difference between structured and unstructured data?
A:
- Structured Data: Organized in rows and columns, stored in databases.
- Unstructured Data: No predefined structure (e.g., images, videos, emails).

Q4: What is the difference between Data Analytics and Data Science?
A:
- Data Analytics focuses on analyzing existing data.
- Data Science involves data collection, cleaning, analysis, and building predictive models using ML and AI.

---------------------
2. EXCEL QUESTIONS
---------------------

Q5: What is a Pivot Table?
A: A Pivot Table is a tool in Excel that summarizes large datasets, helping analyze data by categories with automatic aggregation.

Q6: What is the difference between COUNT, COUNTA, and COUNTIF?
A:
- COUNT: Counts numeric cells.
- COUNTA: Counts all non-empty cells.
- COUNTIF: Counts cells based on a condition.

Q7: How does VLOOKUP work?
A: VLOOKUP searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a corresponding value from a specified column in the same row.

Example:
=VLOOKUP(102, A2:B10, 2, FALSE)

Q8: What is Conditional Formatting?
A: It highlights cells with specific values or conditions (e.g., coloring all cells greater than 100 in green).

Q9: How to remove duplicates in Excel?
A:
- Select the data range.
- Go to Data > Remove Duplicates.
- Choose columns to check.

---------------------
3. SQL QUESTIONS
---------------------

Q10: What is SQL?
A: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases by writing queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data.

Q11: What are JOINS in SQL?
A:
- INNER JOIN: Returns matching rows from both tables.
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matching from the left.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows when there's a match in either table.

Q12: Difference between WHERE and HAVING?
A:
- WHERE filters rows before grouping.
- HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

Q13: SQL Query to find the second highest salary:
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
Q14: SQL Query to find duplicate records:

SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;


Q15: SQL Query to get total salary by department:

SELECT department, SUM(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


Q16: SQL Query to fetch only unique values:

SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;


Q17: SQL Query to sort data in descending order:

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;


STATISTICS & MATH

Q18: What is the mean, median, and mode?
A:

Mean: Average of data values.

Median: Middle value when data is sorted.

Mode: Most frequently occurring value.

Q19: What is standard deviation?
A: It measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean.

Q20: What is correlation?
A: Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive). Zero means no correlation.

Q21: What is a p-value?
A: The p-value measures the probability that the results of your test occurred by chance. A p-value < 0.05 typically indicates statistical significance.

DATA VISUALIZATION & TOOLS

Q22: What are the tools used for Data Analytics?
A:

Excel

SQL

Power BI / Tableau

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

R

Q23: What charts are best for comparison?
A:

Bar Chart: Comparing categories

Line Chart: Trends over time

Pie Chart: Proportions of a whole

Histogram: Frequency distribution

Q24: What is a dashboard?
A: A dashboard is a visual interface that shows key metrics and data summaries in charts, graphs, and tables, often updated in real-time.

SCENARIO / CASE QUESTIONS

Q25: How would you handle missing data?
A:

Remove rows/columns with many missing values.

Replace with mean, median, or mode.

Use predictive models for imputation.

Q26: How do you clean messy data?
A:

Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Standardize formats (dates, currencies)

Validate and correct outliers

Q27: What would you do if a dataset has inconsistent date formats?
A: Standardize all dates into a common format using Excel functions or date parsing in Python/Pandas.

Q28: How do you deal with outliers?
A:

Identify using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)

Decide whether to remove or transform them based on business context

BEHAVIORAL / HR QUESTIONS

Q29: Tell me about yourself.
A: I'm a recent graduate in [Your Degree] with a strong interest in data analytics. I have worked on projects using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and I enjoy turning raw data into actionable insights.

Q30: Why do you want to be a Data Analyst?
A: I enjoy working with data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. Data Analytics allows me to combine technical and business skills.

Q31: Tell me about a project you worked on.
A: I worked on a college project analyzing online sales data. I used Excel to clean the data, SQL to query for patterns, and Power BI to create dashboards showing monthly sales and customer segments.

Q32: What are your strengths?
A: Analytical thinking, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills.

Q33: What are your weaknesses?
A: Sometimes I spend too much time perfecting details, but Iâ€™m learning to manage time more efficiently.
